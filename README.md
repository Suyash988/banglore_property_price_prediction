#Bangalore Price Predictor using Machine Learning (Linear Regression) Model
Overview
Welcome to the Bangalore Price Predictor GitHub repository! This project aims to predict real estate prices in Bangalore using a machine learning linear regression model. Whether you are a data scientist, a machine learning enthusiast, or someone interested in real estate trends, this project provides valuable insights into property price prediction.

1.Introduction
Real estate prices in Bangalore, like in many other cities, are influenced by various factors such as location, size, amenities, and market trends. This project leverages a linear regression model to predict property prices based on historical data. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset containing information about different properties in Bangalore.

2.Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

 2.1 Clone the repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Suyash988/bangalore-price-predictor.git

 2.2 Navigate to the project directory:
    cd bangalore-price-predictor
 2.3 Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Machine Learning Model
The core of this project is a linear regression model implemented using scikit-learn. The model is trained on historical real estate data to learn the relationships between various features and property prices.

4.Results
Explore the 'results/' directory to find visualizations and analyses of the model's predictions. This section provides insights into how well the model performs on the given dataset.    

5.Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you want to improve the model, add new features, or enhance documentation, please feel free to submit pull requests.
